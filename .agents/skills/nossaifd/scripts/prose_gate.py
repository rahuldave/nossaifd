"""The gate of the nossaifd flow: each page that a turn changed must pass the checker and have a recorded pass.

Claude Code and Codex run two hooks of this script.

- `prose_gate.py start` runs when a person sends a message (the UserPromptSubmit hook). It keeps a snapshot of
  the pages: the commit HEAD, and the git blob id of each page that git reports as changed.
- `prose_gate.py hook` runs when the agent tries to end its turn (the Stop hook). It compares the pages with
  the snapshot. A page counts when its content differs from the snapshot, either in the working tree or in a
  commit that the turn made: a commit by the same author, made since the turn started. A pull or a checkout
  brings commits made before the turn, so they do not count, and neither does a merge commit. For each page
  that counts, it runs the checker of the page, check.py unless the map of checkers names another, and it
  looks up the page in the record of passes. A page passes when its checker finds no hard problem and the
  record holds the page as it is now, passed by that checker. Otherwise the hook blocks the stop once and tells the agent which steps of the nossaifd skill remain.

After step 8 of the nossaifd skill, the agent records each page:

    uv run --no-project --quiet python .agents/skills/nossaifd/scripts/prose_gate.py record page.md

`record` refuses a page that has a hard problem. The record lives in the folder of git (.git/nossaifd),
so every worktree of the repository shares it, and it never shows in git status. The snapshots live in the
folder of git of each worktree. The record is a
promise of the agent, not a proof: the hook cannot see whether the declaude pass ran.

With the commit gates of agent_gest_git_skills, this turn gate stays and asks early, and the gate of the commit
decides. The gates are installed when .agents/stack.json turns on the tasker role. Then the block message says
"run `just prose`". That target gives the pages to a fresh agent, which records each page that it passed. The
steps by hand give a page pass, but not the `prose` record that a commit needs.

`prose_gate.py pages [-z] [PATH...]` prints each path that is a page. is_page is the one rule for pages: the
`@pages` of the commit gate uses it through this command, and check-changed, the step prose-check, calls it.

The map of checkers, the file .agents/nossaifd-checkers.json in the root of the project, can name another
checker for some pages, for example the talk checker for a deck. `pages` decides what is a page, and the map
decides how a page is checked. Every command that checks a page uses the map: hook, status, record,
check-diff, `prose_gate.py check [-v] PAGE...` and `prose_gate.py check-changed [-v] [--base REF] [PAGE...]`.
check-changed checks the pages that changed since HEAD, for the step prose-check of `just check`. In CI, or with
--base, it checks the pages that HEAD changed since a base, as check-diff does. A missing or failing checker,
or a broken map, is a hard problem of the page. Each message names the checker of each page. See map_rules for the format.

The hook fails open: an error never blocks. Claude Code and Codex set stop_hook_active when the agent tries
to stop again after a block, and the hook then lets it stop, so it cannot loop. The environment variable
NOSSAIFD_GATE=off, set before Claude Code or Codex starts, turns the gate off. Submodules are out of scope.
